  <h2 a>Hello World! </h2> 
  <h3 >I'm Tom√°s, and I'm a Web Developer.</h3>

  <p align="left">My two passions are Programming and Hospitality, the latter of which I have worked in the past 10 years. It has always been a dream to write and understand code, and in 2020, I had the oportunity to take the Le-Wagon Web Development Bootcamp in Rio de Janeiro.</p>

  <p align="left">I learned many new skills, best practices and of course programming languages such as Ruby and Javascript, but above all, I learned how to apply myself to learn brand new subjects, and to delve deeper "under the hood" to fully understand what is going on when we write code.</p>

  <p align="left">The unprecedented time we are living in has also given me the oportunity of taking most classes and group projects to a remote environment, using tools such as Git, Github, Slack, Zoom, Trello, Figma, Miro, and Whimsical.</p>

  <p align="left"><strong> Currently I am at a full-time position at RD Station as a Software Engineer in the Data & Analytics team. Open for part-time and freelance projects.</strong></p>
