  <h2>Hello World! <br> I am Tom√°s, a Junior Web Developer.</h2>

  <p>My two passions are Programming and Hospitality, the latter of which I have worked in the past 10 years. I have always had a dream to write and understand code, and this year, I had the oportunity to take the Le Wagon Web-Develpoment Bootcamp in Rio de Janeiro.</p>

  <p>I learned many new skills, best practices and of course programming languages such as Ruby and Javascript, but above all, I learned how to apply myself to learn brand new subjects, and to delve deeper "under the hood" to fully understand what is going on when we write code.</p>

  <p>The unprecedented time we are living in has also giving me the oportunity of taking most classes and group projects to a remote environment, using tools such as Git, Github, Slack, Zoom, Trello, Figma, Miro, and Whimsical.</p>

  <p><strong> Currently I am learning React and Redux, and am available for full-time or freelance projects.</strong></p>
