# About-Me

Hello World! I am Tom√°s, a Junior Web Developer.

My two passions are Programming and Hospitality, the latter of which I have worked in the past 10 years. I have always had a dream to write and understand code, and this year, I had the oportunity to take the Le Wagon Web-Develpoment Bootcamp in Rio de Janeiro. 

I learned many new skills, best practices and of course programming languages such as Ruby and Javascript, but above all, I learned how to apply myself to learn brand new subjects, and to delve deeper "under the hood" to fully understand what is going on when we write code.

The unprecedented time we are living in has also giving me the oportunity of taking most classes and group projects to a remote environment, using tools such as Git, Github, Slack, Zoom, Trello, Figma, Miro, and Whimsical.

Currently I am learning React and Redux, and am available for full-time or freelance projects.
